    A MIDI controller designed for rough handling
  description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
    I made this project for my partners work in childcare. She has a classroom of toddlers and while they enjoy the musical toys they have, some of them are not robust enough for long term use. In addition most musical toys are limited to simpler instruments that translate well into a small toy. To make this controller robust I have used standard arcade buttons rated for ten million presses and the case will be constructed from 1/2 inch plywood. The controller is using the QMK firmware to easily implement NKRO and MIDI signals.
