Updated September 4, 2024, from my home in Hamilton, Ontario

This year:

- I am being the best dad I can be to my newborn son.
- Spending as much time as I can with my family at the cottage.

This month:

- I am working on my blog.
- Savouring the last few weeks of summer.

This week:

- I am messing around with an old iPod nano and [rockbox](https://www.rockbox.org/).
- Building this [/now page](https://nownownow.com/about).
