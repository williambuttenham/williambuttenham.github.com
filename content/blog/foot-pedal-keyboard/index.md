I initially wanted to use this foot pedal alongside the [MIDI piano keyboard](../midi-piano)
but instead I have mostly been using it as a panic button while playing video games.
When playing a FPS game, I can use the pedal to quickly switch to my healthlkit,
and then back to my gun. This is much faster than using the keyboard, and I can
keep my fingers on the WASD keys.

The pedal is a two stage pedal, so it can be used as two separate buttons.
Both stages are direct wired to the controller and I have installed the
[Vial QMK firmware](https://github.com/williambuttenham/qmk_firmware/tree/williambuttenham/keyboards/handwired/foot_pedal)
to allow for easy configuration.
